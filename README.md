# Professional-Portfolio

## Description

This is the Website of My personal portfolio.

I made a website of my portfolio with advanced css which has flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. The reason to use those skills is to change the view on the differnt devices. Also, reducing repetition in CSS is our another goal.
